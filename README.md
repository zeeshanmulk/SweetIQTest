There are a lot of files uploaded by Git, but all you would need is the 'app.js' file that has the required function and 'test.js' inside the test folder that has the Mocha test cases.

Please note that inside 'test.js' which points to 'app.js,' the pathing is different based on which platform this code is being run.

Tests are basic operations, invalid operators passed as well as division by zero.
